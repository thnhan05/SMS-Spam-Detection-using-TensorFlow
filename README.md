# 📱 SMS Spam Detection using TensorFlow
Project Description
The SMS Spam Detection using TensorFlow project is a machine learning-based solution to classify and filter spam messages from legitimate ones. By leveraging TensorFlow and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the system analyzes incoming SMS text messages, identifying patterns associated with spam content, and categorizing them accordingly. This tool aims to reduce spam in messaging systems, improving user experience and security.

🌟 Key Features
1.	🧠 Machine Learning Model
o	Utilizes a TensorFlow model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam).
o	Trains the model using a dataset of labeled SMS messages, including both spam and non-spam samples.
2.	🔤 Natural Language Processing (NLP)
o	Tokenizes and preprocesses text (removes stop words, converts to lowercase, etc.).
o	Implements Word Embeddings such as Word2Vec or GloVe to represent text data in numerical form for training.
3.	📊 Data Preprocessing & Augmentation
o	Handles text normalization (e.g., removing special characters, punctuation).
o	Optionally supports data augmentation for better generalization.
4.	⚡ Real-time Prediction
o	Classifies new, incoming SMS messages in real-time, tagging them as spam or non-spam.
o	Supports integration with SMS gateway APIs to automatically filter messages.
5.	📈 Model Evaluation & Improvement
o	Provides detailed model metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate performance.
o	Fine-tuning options to improve model performance.
6.	🔧 Customization
o	Customizable threshold for spam detection.
o	Option to integrate with other spam filtering mechanisms.
7.	📱 User Interface
o	Web or mobile-based UI for monitoring the status of spam detection.
o	Real-time feedback on incoming messages, with options to whitelist or blacklist numbers.

🚀 How to Use
1.	Set Up the Environment 
o	Install the required libraries and dependencies (TensorFlow, NLTK, etc.).
2.	Train the Model 
o	Use a pre-labeled dataset of SMS messages (e.g., SMS Spam Collection Dataset) to train the model.
3.	Deploy the Model 
o	Deploy the trained model to a cloud server or integrate with an SMS gateway API for real-time classification.
4.	Monitor & Improve 
o	Continuously monitor incoming messages and retrain the model periodically to improve performance.
